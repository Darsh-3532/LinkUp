ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT
================================================================================

Data Processing Pipeline - 4 Stages:

Stage 1: Data Ingestion
Input Sources (11 CSV files from Kaggle):
- investments.csv (5.13 MB) - Investment records
- funding_rounds.csv (12.53 MB) - Funding event details
- objects.csv (271.62 MB) - Company and person entities
- relationships.csv (39.39 MB) - Entity relationships
- people.csv (9.69 MB) - Individual profiles
- acquisitions.csv (2 MB) - Merger and acquisition data
- Plus: degrees, funds, ipos, milestones, offices

Stage 2: Sampling & Normalization
- Load investments.csv
- Sample 400 random investments (with seed=42 for reproducibility)
- Extract unique company IDs and investor IDs
- Merge with funding_rounds.csv for detailed information
- Parse and standardize dates to YYYY-MM-DD format
- Clean and handle missing values

Stage 3: Network Construction
Company Nodes (390 unique):
- Attributes: ID, label, type (company), name

Investor Nodes (350 unique):
- Attributes: ID, label, type (investor), name

Edges (400 relationships):
- Source: investor_object_id
- Target: funded_object_id
- Metadata: funding type, raised amount, date, valuation

Stage 4: Aggregation & Statistics
- Funding type distribution (categorized by round type)
- Date range extraction (minimum to maximum dates)
- Edge counts per funding type
- Network density calculations
- Connected component analysis

Key Algorithms:
- Random Sampling: Stratified sampling for representative data subset
- Graph Construction: Adjacency list representation
- Data Aggregation: Group-by operations for filtering
- Temporal Analysis: Date range extraction and trending
